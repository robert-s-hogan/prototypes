## Mission & Purpose

“The purpose of the Douglas Whited PTO is to enhance and support the educational experience at Douglas Whited Elementary, to develop a closer connection between school and home by encouraging and facilitating parent involvement, and to improve the environment at Douglas Whited Elementary through volunteer and financial support.”

## What We Do

- **Fundraising**  
  We organize events such as fun runs, auctions, and spirit nights to raise funds for classroom supplies, field trips, and educational technology.

- **Community Building**  
  We host family activities and school-wide celebrations to bring parents, students, and teachers together outside the classroom.

  We connect parents with a range of opportunities—everything from helping in classrooms to coordinating large-scale events.
